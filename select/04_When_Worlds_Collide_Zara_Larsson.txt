I wanna act a fool
I wanna lose my cool
I wanna hit the roof
With someone like you

'Cause when worlds collide
We put hopelessness aside
When worlds collide
We put hopelessness aside

I wanna drop my guard
I wanna jump real hard
Wanna start some fizz
Whit someone new
Just like you

'Cause when worlds collide
We put hopelessness aside
When worlds collide
We put hopelessness aside
When worlds collide

When worlds collide
We put hopelessness aside

I'm gonna build from scratch
Bring on the aftermath
Yeah, i'm back on track
With a better view
Just like you

'Cause when worlds collide
We put hopelessness aside
When worlds collide
We put hopelessness aside
When worlds collide

When worlds collide
We put hopelessness aside

Yeah, That's what it feels like, alright
We put hopelessness aside
Tonight (tonight)
We put hopelessness aside

I wanna act a fool
I wanna lose my cool
I wanna hit the roof
With someone like you

Yeah, that's what it feels like, alright
We put hopelessness aside
That's what it feels like, alright
We put hopelessness aside
When worlds collide

When worlds collide
When worlds collide
When worlds collide
We put hopelessness aside
When worlds collide
