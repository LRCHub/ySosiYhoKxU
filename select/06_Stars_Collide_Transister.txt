I'm always falling over that old box of clothes
And the television
And the broken video
I should've thrown that stupid stuff out years ago
With the yellow pages
With the torn-out pages

CHORUS:
I can't have you
The way I used to
But I still love you

I never, ever thought that I'd forget your face
I've been trying to get through
But I can't quite see you
I know you're laughing in some other place
And the stars laugh with you
And I forgive you

CHORUS

Stars collide
And the rivers run dry
Everything grows
Everything dies
People we love get locked inside
Forever

CHORUS X3
