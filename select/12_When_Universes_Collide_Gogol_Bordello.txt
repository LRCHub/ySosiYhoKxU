Why didn't you come when I beat my drum
And screamed off my head out into the night?
Scared of the slums, afraid of the guns
Don't wanna see the hoodlums fight
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
Don't wanna see the hoodlums fight
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
Don't wanna see the hoodlums fight
I was gonna come when I heard your drum
And you screamed your head off into the night
I grew up around different part of town
But even the universes collide
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
Even the universes collide
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
Even the universes collide
There was no letter, no family matter
And by the castes, we don't divide
It just father told me, tonight authorities
Preparing ethno-cleansing rite
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
Preparing ethno-cleansing rite
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
Preparing ethno-cleansing rite
Two helicopters with machine guns
Over the slums, proudly will glide
So when the universes collide
Son, don't get caught on the wrong side
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
When the universes collide
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
Son, don't get caught on the wrong side
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
When the universes collide
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
Son, don't get caught on the wrong side
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
When the universes collide
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
Son, don't get caught on the wrong side
Why didn't you come when I beat my drum
And screamed off my head out into the rain?
Your mother told you, our father stopped you
Out of the hospitals, you are afraid
Hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
When the universe will collide
Hey, hey, hey, hey, na, na, na, na
Don't get caught up on the wrong side
Oh, oh, hey, na, na, na, na
Oh, when the universe will collide
Oh, oh, hey, na, na, na, na
Son, don't get caught up on the wrong side
