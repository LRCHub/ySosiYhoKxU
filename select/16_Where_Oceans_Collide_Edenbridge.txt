The span of life is forcing you to set to rights
And tells you look before you leap
Maybe, get lost in the translation the delights
Before you really dig in deep

Can you feel them eye to eye?
Can you make them unify?

This is not a dream
This is not a test
Colors clashing like a wave in crest
It's the line of sight
Where oceans collide
The warren of your restless mind

Are the odds even, are they left out in the cold?
In this hereditary taint
And maybe keeping you to finally unfold
To dizzy heights and be unchained

Can you feel them eye to eye?
Can you make them unify?

This is not a dream
This is not a test
Colors clashing like a wave in crest
It's the line of sight
Where oceans collide
The warren of your restless mind

This is not a dream
This is not a test
Colors clashing like a wave in crest
It's the line of sight
Where oceans collide
The warren of your restless mind

Turn on a ride
Where oceans collide
